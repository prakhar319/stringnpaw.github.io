<div class="aboutus sections" id="about">
	<p>Hi,<br>I am an enthusiastic engineer pursuing bachelors in technology, majoring in Electronics and Electrical Engineering. I love to solve problems and have creativity, smart working, and leadership as my skill-set. I am a self-motivated individual who is always eager to learn and innovate new technologies and methodologies.</p>
	<p>Apart from my academics interests, things I am crazy about are: </p>
	<p><b>Dogs - My Love</b><br>“Happiness is a warm puppy.” — Charles M. Schulz
	</p>
	<p>Why I am in love with dogs? Well, I feel dogs share our lives in a way that no other species can, and they're so commonplace that it's easy to take their faithful companionship for granted. I firmly believe in dog being a "man's best friend" I love it when my dog Whisky waits for me by the door, face smiling, mouth open and tail wagging, ready to dote on me, his best friend in the world. Could I ask for anymore love in life?</p>
	<p><b>Guitar - My Passion</b><br>Since my childhood,first thing that drove me crazy was Music. Why I particularly liked  guitar, is because it’s an instrument that fits me particularly well as it is a very individualistic instrument. The work of the  guitar taught me what can be achieved with daily practice. Playing guitar makes me challenge myself everyday, to become a better player. For me, it’s a method of living.</p>
	<p><b>Masala Chai - My Motivation</b><br>“You can do it” - Says me tea to me, every morning, every afternoon, and whenever I need motivation at all possible odd hours.<br>There's nothing as refreshing and relaxing as a cup of tea. It's my favourite hot drink by a long way and one I look forward to every day. For 10 minutes I sit down and relax with a 'cuppa'. I find that nothing picks me up as quickly when I need a recharge.For me it’s never a cup of tea, it is “an oasis of relaxation" in a busy day. </p>
